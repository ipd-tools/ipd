Description: Performs valid statistical inference on predicted data (IPD) using recent methods, where for a subset of the data, the outcomes have been predicted by an algorithm. Provides a wrapper function with specified defaults for the type of model and method to be used for estimation and inference. Further provides methods for tidying and summarizing results.
